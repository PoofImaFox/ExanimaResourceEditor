# Exanima Resource Editor
This is a GUI application to allow the community to edit or change resource packed files.

# Howto:
You cannot launch the exe, you must supply it arguments via console or windows explorer drag & drop.  
Drag the RPK file onto the executable. You will be displayed with the packed filenames.
